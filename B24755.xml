            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

And being also informed, that the Farmers, Inn-Keepers, and such as Quartered Their Majesties Troops the last Year, apprehending that if they make and lay in Hay, it may be a means to have them burthened with Quartering the Army next Winter; And that by having none, they may avoid it, do neglect to make the Hay of the Lands laid up as aforesaid. Therefore to prevent the evil conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence it would be to their Majesties service, and the Kingdom in general, if Hay should not be made; And to encourage all persons concerned, to make up the Hay of the Lands laid up as aforesaid: We do hereby assure them, they shall have the disposal of the Hay made by them, to make the best advantage thereof they can, or they shall receive satisfaction at the Market Rate for such part thereof as shall be taken by any of the Army, or used in Their Majesties Service. And where any Commons or other Lands have been laid up, and the Tenants or Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors do neglect to mow, save and bring in the Hay thereof in due season, We do
<pb facs="tcp:186755:2"/> hereby direct the Collectors imployed by the Commissioners of Their Majesties Revenue, in their respective Districts, to return the Names of such Tenants or Proprietors, who shall so neglect to mow and save the same: And We shall look upon them as disaffected to Their Majesties Government. and the said Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector shall agree with such persons as shall undertake to make up the Hay of the said Commons or other Lands neglected as aforesaid, and shall allow or pay for the mowing, making thereof, and delivering one third part of the Hay so made, or money for the same. at the Market Rate then currant, at the Election of the persons making the same; and the said Collectors are to give their said Majesties Commissioners account of their proceedings therein from time to time. And whereas by reason of the present War, there are not so many hands for bringing in the Harvest as at other times, of which many Labourers and other Persons in several parts of this Kingdom, do take advantage and obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately refuse to work, unless they can have double wages, or much greater than usually hath heretofore been paid. We hereby require Their Majesties Iustices of the Peace to meet and settle the Rates and Wages of Labourers, according to the Statutes in that case made and provided, and carefully to see the said Statutes duly observed, in punishing all Idle persons that shall refuse to work, or that shall exact more Wages than are or shall be setled by the Iustices of the Peace in the respective Counties. And being likewise informed, there are seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral loose Idle persons, going up and down the Country, on pretence of begging, who are able to get their Living by Labour: We do hereby strictly charge and require all Sheriffs, Iustices of the Peace, High and Petty Constables, in their several Baronies and Parishes, that they cause all such persons as begg, and are able as aforesaid to make Hay, or do any other Harvest work, to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed therein, at such wages as are usual, and if any of them refuse, they shall be deemed as Spyes and Vagabonds, and as such shall be punished with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most rigour of the Laws in that case made and provided, whereof all persons concerned are to take due notice.</p>
